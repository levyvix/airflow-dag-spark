# End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering project, recreated from a course. The project demonstrates the integration of various tools and technologies, including Apache Airflow, Docker, Spark Clusters, Scala, Python, and Java.

## Overview

In this project, you will:

1. Set up Apache Airflow: Orchestrate and manage data workflows.
2. Use Docker: Containerize applications for consistent and isolated environments.
3. Configure Spark Clusters: Set up and manage clusters for distributed data processing.
4. Develop Jobs in Multiple Languages: Write data processing jobs in Scala, Python, and Java.
5. Submit Jobs to Spark Cluster: Execute the jobs on Spark clusters for processing.
6. Monitor Live Results: Track the progress and results of your data processing jobs in real-time.
